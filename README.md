## Project Description

This Weather App project is designed to help you build a simple web application for fetching and displaying weather information. With this project, you'll learn how to interact with weather APIs, process JSON data, create user-friendly forms, and display weather details on a webpage. It's a practical project that you can use to improve your web development skills and enhance your portfolio.

## Project Outline

1. **Set up HTML Document**: Start by creating a blank HTML document with the necessary links to your JavaScript and CSS files.

2. **API Interaction Functions**: Write functions that interact with the API. These functions should be able to take a location as input and retrieve the weather data for that location. For now, simply use `console.log()` to display the information.

3. **Data Processing Functions**: Implement functions that process the JSON data received from the API. These functions should return an object containing only the relevant data needed for the application.

4. **User Input Form**: Create a user-friendly form that allows users to input their location and fetch the weather information. The initial implementation can still log the data to the console.

5. **Display Weather Information**: Display the retrieved weather information on the webpage. Consider adding styling to enhance the user experience.

6. **Optional Loading Component**: As an optional enhancement, you can add a "loading" component that displays from the moment the form is submitted until the data is received from the API. Test this feature using DevTools to ensure compatibility with low-end devices.

7. **GitHub Repository**: Finally, push your project to a GitHub repository and share your solution with others.

**Important**: Remember to use your own API keys and follow security best practices when dealing with sensitive information. Never expose API keys on the client-side.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your development environment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
3. Implement the steps outlined in the project description.

## Usage

This project is designed for learning and educational purposes. You can use it to build your own weather application and practice working with APIs and web development.

## API Interaction

In the `api-interaction.js` file, you will find functions for interacting with weather APIs. These functions fetch weather data for a specified location.

## User Input Form

The user input form is implemented in the `index.html` file. It allows users to input their location and fetch weather information.

## Display Weather Information

Weather information is displayed on the webpage in the `index.html` file. You can style the information to enhance the user experience.

## Optional Loading Component

The optional loading component is not included by default. However, you can implement it in the `index.html` file to provide a better user experience while waiting for data to load.
